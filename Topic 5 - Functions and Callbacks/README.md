## Functions and callbacks

1. Write a python function that returns the greatest of three numbers.
2. Write a python function that takes a dictionary where the keys are english alphabets and the values are their corresponding ASCII values, and an alphabet. The function returns the corresponding ASCII code.
3. Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
4. Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pallendrome or not
5. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the index of the first non-repeating integer in the list. If all the integers are repeated, the function should return -1.
6. Create a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of the first occurrence and the index of the last occurrence of each unique integer in the list.
7. Write a Python function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. The function should use recursion to achieve this
8. Implement a Python function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, and returns the tuple with the largest sum of the two integers. The function should be able to handle empty lists and lists with invalid tuples (e.g. tuples that do not contain two integers).
9. Create a Python function that takes a list of integers and a target value, and returns a tuple containing the indices of the two integers in the list that add up to the target value. If no such pair exists, the function should return None.
10. Write a python function that takes a list and a callback function. The callback function should be applied on each element of the list and the operated list should be printed on the screen.
11. Write a python program to perform arithmetic operatations based on a callback funtion for the operation.
12. Write a program that converts temperature from celcius to farenheit and vice versa based on a callback function.
13. Write a program to user inner functions (nested functions) to perform basic arithmetic operations.
