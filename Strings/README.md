## Strings
1. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and reverses the order of its characters.
2. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and removes all vowels from it.
3. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and checks if it is a palindrome. Reverse the string manually here and do not use inbuild methods for the same.
4. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and replaces all spaces with underscores.
5. Write a program that takes two strings as input from the user, and checks if one string is a substring of the other.
6. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and checks if it is a valid email address.
7. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and removes all punctuation marks from it.
8. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and capitalizes the first letter of each word. Do not use inbuilt method (string.title()) for the same.
9. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and calculates the number of times a given word appears in it.
10. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and removes all duplicate characters from it.
11. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and inserts a given character at a specified index.
12. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and splits it into a list of words, removing any words that contain a given character.
13. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and generates a dictionary where each key is a letter in the string, and each value is the number of times that letter appears in the string, ignoring case.
14. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and replaces all instances of a given word with a different word, ignoring case.
15. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and generates a new string by rearranging its characters in alphabetical order.
16. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and removes all instances of a given substring from the string.
17. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and converts it to a list of integers representing the ASCII values of each character.
18. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and generates a new string by shifting each character in the string by a given number of positions.
19. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and checks if it is a valid IPv4 address.
20. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and returns a new string with all occurrences of a given word replaced by asterisks.
21. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and returns the first non-repeated character in the string.
22. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user, and returns a new string with all occurrences of a given character replaced by its opposite case.
