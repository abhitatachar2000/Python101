## Numbers and Arithmetic
1. Build a calculator that can handle the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) It should take two numbers and an operator as input, perform the calculation, and return the result.
2. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines if it is a prime number or not. The program should print 'Prime' if the number is prime, and 'Not Prime' if the number is not prime.
3. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines if it is even or not. The program should print 'Even' if the number is even, and 'Odd' if the number is odd.
4. Write a program to input an integer from the user and determine the factorial of that number. The program should then output the factorial of the number.
5. Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input from the user and generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series. The program should print each number in the series on a new line.
6. Write a program that takes two positive integers as input from the user and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD). The program should print the calculated GCD.
7. Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points in two-dimensional space as input from the user, and calculates the Euclidean distance between them. The program should print the calculated distance.
8. Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user, and calculates the maximum and minimum among them. The program should print the maximum and minimum numbers.
9. Write a program that takes the radius of a circle as input from the user, and calculates its area and circumference. The program should print the calculated area and circumference, rounded to two decimal places.
10. Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input from the user, and calculates its area and perimeter. The program should print the calculated area and perimeter.
11. Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points in two-dimensional space as input from the user, and calculates the slope of the line that passes through these two points. The program should print the calculated slope, rounded to two decimal places.
12. Write a program that takes a temperature value and a unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit) as input from the user, and converts the temperature to the other unit of measurement. The program should print the converted temperature, rounded to two decimal places.
13. Write a program that finds the sum of squares of first n numbers
